            <h2>2 Nephi 4:34</h2>
            <p>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; 
                for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient 
                for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>
